Each row in the dataset represents a unique ride request, capturing the location from which the ride was requested (City or Airport), the date and time of the request, the ride status (Trip Completed, Cancelled, or No Cars Available), and the completion time where applicable. These features provide a rich foundation for analyzing patterns related to rider demand, service fulfillment, and operational bottlenecks.\n",

Missing values were primarily found in the Drop Timestamp column, which is expected as only completed rides have a drop time. Duplicate entries were checked and eliminated to ensure the integrity of the analysis. Additional derived features were created for more granular analysis, including Hour (extracted from the request timestamp) and a categorized Time Slot variable that groups requests into logical intervals such as Late Night, Early Morning, Morning, Afternoon, and Evening.\n",

        "To simplify and standardize the analysis of ride outcomes, a new categorical variable titled Ride Success was introduced. This variable classifies ride outcomes into three distinct categories: Fulfilled (Trip Completed), Cancelled (Cancelled by driver or rider), and Unfulfilled (No Cars Available). This feature enabled a clearer comparison of service performance across different times and pickup points.\n",
