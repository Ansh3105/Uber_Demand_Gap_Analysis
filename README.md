# Uber_Demand_Gap_Analysis

# 🚕 Uber Demand Gap Analysis

This project analyzes Uber ride request data to identify demand-supply gaps across different time periods and locations(City And Airport). Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL queries, Python visualizations, and Excel dashboards, the study aims to uncover critical patterns that contribute to ride cancellations and "No Cabs Available" issues — especially during peak demand hours.

---

## 📌 Objective

The objective of this project is to improve Uber's operational efficiency and customer satisfaction by identifying when and where the platform fails to meet rider demand. By analyzing request and cancellation patterns, we aim to uncover root causes and recommend actionable strategies to enhance cab availability and service reliability.

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- 🚫 **High cancellation rates** were observed during early morning (5 AM–9 AM) and late night (10 PM–12 AM) time slots.
- 🛫 **Airports and city pickups** during these hours showed the highest "No Cabs Available" frequency.
- ✅ **Mid-day hours (11 AM–5 PM)** showed stable demand-supply balance with fewer cancellations.
- 📈 **Data visualizations** and **Excel dashboards** support deeper operational planning and decision-making.

---

## 🧪 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** – for data cleaning and visualization
- **SQL** – for structured data querying and aggregation
- **Microsoft Excel** – for dashboarding and visual summaries
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for code walkthrough and EDA

## 🧠 Business Value

This analysis equips Uber’s operations and product teams with data-driven insights to:
- Improve driver shift allocation
- Introduce demand-based pricing
- Pre-emptively tackle cab unavailability
- Enhance customer satisfaction and platform reliability

---

## ✅ Limitations

- Dataset lacks real-time driver status and GPS coordinates
- No fare or revenue data included
- Analysis limited to a specific city and timeframe
- Drop times are missing in some records, affecting ride duration estimation

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analysis can be used to solve real-world business problems. By identifying patterns in failed ride requests, Uber can take proactive steps to address customer pain points and ensure a smoother, more reliable experience.
